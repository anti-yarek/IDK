        <p>A banger.</p>
        <p>Maryland rapper IDK dropped off his debut effort early Wednesday morning titled Is He Real?, a record that is delivered through his Clue label. The album showcases the rapper's diverse talents as he emotes artistically throughout the 14-track project, but a stand-out song on the compilation is undoubtedly "Porno" featuring Pusha T and J.I.D. 
        </p>
        <p>The song is non-linear and through the journey from beginning to end, it takes a few twists and turns—including a A Tribe Called Quest sample of "Bonita Applebum." All three of the rappers come with bars on this one, and while they pan out well together, there are a few moments where things sound a little disjointed (like the chanting bridge in the middle of the track). However, this is one of the best features of Is He Real?, and shows what happens when one artist is collectively an emcee, a lyricist, and a rapper.

        <p>[Chorus: IDK]
            Your strawberry lemonade lips
            Make a nigga blood pressure go drip, drip, drip
            Bad hoes is the devil, like six-six-sixBad hoes is the devil, like six-six-six
            When I got you on my mind ain't no room for a thot
            When you layin' on my chest ain't no room for my heart
            Girl, you know we wastin' time like tick, tick, tick
            Girl, you suckin' up my time like tick, tick, tick
        </p>
        <p>[Verse 1: IDK]
            The bible say beatin' my dick and killin' is equal (Huh?)
            But that don't add up (Right?), 'cause the amount of timesThat I milk my shit I'll probably be considered serial (Ayy, hahaha)
            Them Cocoa Puff tittie balls make a nigga balls
            Fall inside of her jaws while her drawls fall
            All like a nightstand in the earthquake caused
            By the backstroke, dog style, all wild
            Kill the pretty kitty, leave a X over its eyes like a KAWS clown
            Shit! That's a fuckin' bar
            Fuck her in a '69, that's a fuckin' car
            Rolls Royce and the roof is the fuckin' stars
            Killin' niggas every time I write like it's fuckin' "Saw"
            Leave 'em charred, leave 'em Charmander without the tail spark
            (That mean that nigga dead!) Oh well, I have no fuckin' heart
            Back to my banana, this brain food is why she smart
            Yellow and her head on point, it's like her brother's
            Bart Simpson, no O.J, it ain't fit so she must acquitTake my Johnnie Cochran out and sit it on her pretty lips
            Sex addict with no intent to ever quitThis what happens when you exposed to porn at the age of six

        <p>[Verse 3: JID]
            She wanna lock lips, I just pulled over, made her stop it
            Inside of my whip, when I'm drivin' it's called a cockpit
            Obviously, if she ride with the kid then she givin' knowledge
            Like institutions disguised in the schools and collectin' profits
            I missed
            Give her the shit that she like some type of magician (Go 'head)
            My magical wand mission, this clitoris infamous (Go 'head)
            God-given, devil insidious (Go 'head)
            No condoms in the condominium (Go 'head)
            Idiot, she do this shit for any and many men or 50 Cent (Go 'head)Shit, I am 50 Cent, haha, word to my nigga Keem
